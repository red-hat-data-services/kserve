# V1beta1InferenceServiceValidator

InferenceServiceValidator is responsible for validating the InferenceService resource when it is created, updated, or deleted.  NOTE: The +kubebuilder:object:generate=false marker prevents controller-gen from generating DeepCopy methods, as this struct is used only for temporary operations and does not need to be deeply copied.
